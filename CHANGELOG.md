## New

- `BalanceButton` component for displaying the balance of the connected wallet (in a button), opens the profile modal

## Bug Fixes

- Single chain tooltip was not inherting theme correctly

## Misc.

- Visual debug message in the UI when there is a custom client config setup for `CoinbaseWalletConnector` that does not have `headlessMode:true`
